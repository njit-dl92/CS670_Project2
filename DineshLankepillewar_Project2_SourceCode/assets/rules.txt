Digital Cluedo Game Rules

1. Objective:
   - Solve the mystery by identifying:
     1. The murderer.
     2. The weapon used.
     3. The room where the murder occurred.

2. Setup:
   - The solution (murderer, weapon, and room) is randomly generated by the system and kept hidden.
   - The system distributes random cards to each player (excluding the solution cards).
   - Each player starts the game with no clues except their dealt cards.

3. Gameplay:
   - The game proceeds in turns, managed by the system.
   - Players roll a virtual die to determine movement across rooms.
   - Upon entering a room, players can make a suggestion (guess) by selecting a suspect, weapon, and the current room from the provided menu.

4. Suggestions:
   - Players make a suggestion by choosing options in the app.
   - The system will check the suggestion and reveal a card disproving it if possible (shown privately to the suggesting player).
   - If no other players can disprove the suggestion, it remains inconclusive.

5. Accusations:
   - Players can make an accusation at any point by selecting their final guess.
   - If the accusation matches the hidden solution, the player wins.
   - If the accusation is incorrect, the player is eliminated from making further accusations but may continue disproving others' suggestions.

6. Rules for Movement:
   - Players move virtually across rooms, guided by the app.
   - Moving between rooms via secret passages is supported if applicable.

7. Winning the Game:
   - The first player to correctly identify all three components of the solution wins the game.
   - If all players are eliminated except one, that player loses the game.

8. Digital Features:
   - A notepad is available to track clues, guesses, and cards revealed by other players.
